"""
Please create a file sending simulator using UDP ( no connect(), just use send-to and recv-from) in which file are fragmented and sent using block per 1 kb.
implement client and server at different PC.

[1]: Client can pick file name that would be sent (minimum text file size 10mb)
[2]: then client send the file seqentially
[3]: after it finished sending, server and client will display how many % data is sucessfully delivered
